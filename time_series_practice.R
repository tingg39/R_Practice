# The time plot immediately reveals some interesting features.
# 
# There was a period in 1989 when no passengers were carried â€” this was due to an industrial dispute.
# There was a period of reduced load in 1992. This was due to a trial in which some economy class seats were replaced by business class seats.
# A large increase in passenger load occurred in the second half of 1991.
# There are some large dips in load around the start of each year. These are due to holiday effects.
# There is a long-term fluctuation in the level of the series which increases during 1987, decreases in 1989, and increases again through 1990 and 1991.
# There are some periods of missing observations.
